# Overview

## User types

In P4 Warehouse there are two completely unique styles of users.

1. &#x20;**Web Dispatcher**, the web dispatcher uses a computer and a modern web browser to manage the flow in and out of the warehouse. The web dispatcher also controls the workflow of the PDT users. Think of the web dispatches as the control tower at an airport.
2. **PDT user**, the PDT user is the people out in the warehouse executing the instructions set to them from the Web Dispatcher. These are the people physically receiving Purchase Order and RMA's, picking and shipping outbound orders, Cycle Counting inventory. These users work from a mobile device typically with a barcode scanner.
