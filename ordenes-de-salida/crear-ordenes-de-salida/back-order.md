# Back Order

{% hint style="success" %}
A backorder is left over products that did not get shipped on the original order.
{% endhint %}

Back Orders are typically auto created either by your ERP or by P4 Warehouse. In rare situations the process is ship and cancel, in this configuration there will be no back order generated. Ship and Cancel is common in the food industry.

A backorder will look like a normal Pick Ticket however, in the numbering scheme you will notice a \_1 or \_2 in the order number indicating the version of the backorder.
