Tote Label explained: A tote label can either be a box label or a pallet label depending on how you ship. An example would be a company shipping eCommerce orders, every box is going to a different customer, in this case the tote label is applied to every box.&#x20;

Note: when waving for box labels, select Carton at waving. When needing pallet labels select Pallet labels at waving.
