# Truck Load

Truck Load shipping generates a Bill of Lading and allows you to put several orders on one trailer shipment.

In the screen above you will see there are four different orders shipping on the same trailer, all the required information about the load is captured on the Truck Load screen. This data is used to create the Bill of Lading.

Orders can be added to a bill of lading one at a time or in bulk depending on your processes.

Once the Truck Load screen is set to Stage the BOL button will be available.&#x20;

Signatures are captured on the PDT by going into the Truck Load shipment screen.
