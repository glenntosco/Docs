# Allocation

If Pick ticket is in a draft state it will need to be released to Floor to begin the processes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Releasing to Floor moves the Order from Draft (editable) to a live document.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the event your instance of P4 Warehouse is connected via integration with your ERP, orders will not show draft status and cannot be edited from the WMS, edits must take place from the ERP.
{% endhint %}

![P4 Warehouse Sales Order Screen](<../.gitbook/assets/Pick ticket screen-01.png>)

Release to Floor can be accomplished by single order or in groups.

{% hint style="info" %}
Auto processing for different stages of fulfilment can be enabled or disabled in Setup->System->Configuration->Business->Fulfilment->Automation
{% endhint %}

If all information is correct, the user is ready to allocate using system rules and user selections by pressing the Allocate button. As you can see in the two images below this screen (most screens in P4 Warehouse) are dynamic, meaning the screen only shows the options that are available for this order or group of orders. The first photo below does not have items with Lot Numbers or Expiry therefore the screen does not display the options that you see on the second photo below.

{% hint style="success" %}
P4 Warehouse has the strongest algorithm in the industry. The process of Allocation is the system scanning and deciding what needs to be picked based on the rules in the system and the settings on the allocation screen.
{% endhint %}
