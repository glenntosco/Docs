# Cycle Count Approval

![P4 Warehouse Cycle Count Approval](<../.gitbook/assets/image (183).png>)

If you have Cycle Count approvals set to "required" in the settings screen, then you will need to open the screen below to approve any cycle counts.

Please note in the image below, the quantity remains the same as before the cycle count until the Cycle Count is approved. This reduces unnecessary cycle count adjustments.

Once the Cycle Count is approved the bin location will reflex the correct quantities.

If you want Cycle counts to be applied immediately, then in the configuration you will need to turn off the option for cycle count approvals.
