# Pick Ticket Picking

Pick Ticket Picking is designed for normal warehouse picking. PDT Pick Ticket Picking and Wave picking are similar except Wave Picking (batch picking) allows you to pick various orders at once.

After an order is Allocated and Waved there will be at least one pick label (Tote Label) generated and printed, the printed label will print to the user's assigned printer, or to a zone printer.
