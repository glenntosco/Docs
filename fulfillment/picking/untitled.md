## Full Pack Picking Overview

_For detailed information on Full Pack Picking please contact your P4 Warehouse Partner._

{% hint style="warning" %}
This requires pre-printed LPN labels to complete this process. All Inventory for the orders needs to be in LPN Storage at the beginning of the process.
{% endhint %}

Full Pack picking is designed to pick full boxes for bulk shipping.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In this style of picking, you do not wave the order, simply print the order number on a label to start the picking. The appropriate labels will print as needed. This style can be "picked" by several people at once.
{% endhint %}

To process a "Full Pack Picking" order, the web dispatcher will stop their process after the Allocation process. For this pick style you DO NOT wave the order. In the top right of the screen there is a circle icon there you will find an option "Print Barcode" here you will print as many labels as you have people processing the order.&#x20;

After giving the Order Number Barcode labels to the picking team they will enter Full Pack Picking on the PDT, at this point follow the directions on the PDT to process the pallet labeling.&#x20;
