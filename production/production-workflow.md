Production Workflow allows the production order to be tracked through the different stages of the production process.

With the P4 Warehouse production workflow tool the production process can be mapped. At each stage of production the production order is scanned so the stage of production is always known. Also in the link between two process there can be data caputred. For example, when a product fails inspection and is moved to the failed area a reason for the failure can be captured. This will assist in understand what is happening in the production process that is causing the products to fail the inspection, this will lead to less errors and help tune the production process to minumize errors in the production area.
