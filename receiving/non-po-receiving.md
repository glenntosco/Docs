# Non-PO Receiving

Non-PO receiving is for receiving extra items shipped by the provider, it still requires a base Purchasing document.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This is for receiving extra items on an EXISTING Purchase Order. This function is not for receiving items without a Purchase Order.

To receive an item that does not have a Purchase Order for the provider you will need to use the adjustment function.
{% endhint %}
