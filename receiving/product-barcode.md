# Product Barcode

Product barcode will allow the receiver to print barcode labels for product that is missing labels before receiving the product.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Depending on the configuration the system will prompt the receiver to print labels after the product is received these labels will include key information in barcode format like serial number, lot number, expiry date. Often products do not have lot numbers and dates in barcode format from the manufacture.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
It is critical that all products have a barcode label on them before the end of the receiving process. Products without barcodes will be very difficult (basically impossible) to manage inside the warehouse causing unnecessary delays in other processes like picking.
{% endhint %}
