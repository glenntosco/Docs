# Product Move

Product Move is the process where a worker moves product from one bin to the other bin.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
There are various reasons to move product around the warehouse, however best practice is to receive the product and not move it until time to pick a sales order, there is less chance of error and less chance of product damage.
{% endhint %}

Select Product Move option then scan the first bin where the product is currently assigned.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (102).png>)

Now scan the product

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (207).png>)

Now enter the quantity you will move

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (260).png>)

Now scan the bin where you are moving the product

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (101).png>)

The P4 Warehouse will confirm that the product was moved

Depending on your specific configuration you may or may not be allowed to move product that is allocated to a sales order.&#x20;
