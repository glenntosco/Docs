# Cycle Count

The Cycle Count option is for the process of counting the inventory physically within the warehouse (bins). Typical reasons for cycle counting are to obtain an accurate inventory count within a bin or the entire warehouse. Over time the actual inventory within the warehouse might not equal what is accounted in the P4 Warehouse software system (due to breakages, theft, etc.). Hence, a cycle count accurately accounts for the physical inventory. The Cycle Count features an option field for Bin at the top and a Log section below.&#x20;
