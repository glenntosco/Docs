# Create Customer

The Customers page features a listing of all the customers available within the Warehouse Management System software. There are columns for Customer Number, Company Name, Description, Contact Person, Email, Client, and Created. There is also a “New” button at the top right (to create new customer profiles and a “Refresh” button (to update the list after any changes). The “Export All Data” button is located just under the refresh button appearing as a black folder encircling a white X.

The page will then display the Customer profile page (in this example, Customer: c2). On the left side is a Details section to input an email address, a contact person and miscellaneous information in the Description field. In the upper right corner are two buttons: the “Update” button will save any changes made to the customer profile and the “Refresh” button will display any such changes. On the right is the Addresses section to input one or more addresses for this customer, including an “Add” button for the addition of new addresses. Lastly at the bottom is a Settings section for Product Expiry Allowance (the customer does not want any item that expires within the time chosen; default set to 70 days).
