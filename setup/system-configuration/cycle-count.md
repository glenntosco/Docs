# Cycle Count

### Cycle Count Authorization

In the Setup > System > Configuration > Business this check box will decide if the P4 Warehouse automatically applies Cycle Counts or if the Cycle Count must first be approved.

{% hint style="warning" %}
By checking this box and clicking save this will cause the cycle count not to be applied or in the event of an ERP Interface, the Cycle count will not be applied or uploaded until it is approved by a web dispatcher.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
By leaving this box unchecked Cycle Counts are applied and if applicable uploaded to your ERP.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
