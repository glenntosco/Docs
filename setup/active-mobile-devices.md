# Active Mobile Devices

In this Administrator level screen, you can monitor the actions of warehouse workers on the mobile devices. Also, from this screen you will be able to disconnect users and see the amount of time the user has been connected.

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on your level of security you may be able to monitor warehouse works via the Active Devices Screen, ask your administrator if you do not see this option.
{% endhint %}
