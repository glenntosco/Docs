# KPI Creation

The first step in KPI creation is deciding what data you will report, then create the SQL query to pull the data from the database.

![P4 Warehouse Widget List](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (258).png>)

In this screen you can edit an existing report, or you can create a new report.

{% hint style="info" %}
To create reports you will need to know TSQL, the best option is to download the database [backup ](database-backups.md)to create your SQL statement.
{% endhint %}

By clicking the name of an existing Widget, you will be able to edit the reports SQL statement.

Once you have your SQL Query working you will need to add a Chart.

* In the chart settings set the Name to a name of your choice
* For Chart Type select the type of chart you need, Area, Bar, Column, Line or Pie
* Put the exact name of your column in the Argument Field and the Value Field.
* Put the name of your Series Column
