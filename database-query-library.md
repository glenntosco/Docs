## Query Usage Notes

### Performance Tips
1. Always include appropriate WHERE clauses to limit date ranges
2. Use indexes on commonly filtered columns (dates, states, reference numbers)
3. Consider creating views for frequently used complex queries
4. Monitor query execution plans for optimization opportunities

### Security Considerations
1. All queries are read-only (SELECT statements only)
2. Consider implementing row-level security for multi-tenant environments
3. Audit query usage through the Query Builder interface
4. Restrict access to sensitive billing and client data

### Customization
1. Replace date ranges with parameters for dynamic reporting
2. Add client/warehouse filters for multi-tenant deployments
3. Extend queries with custom Info1-Info10 fields as needed
4. Integrate with reporting tools like SSRS, Power BI, or Crystal Reports
