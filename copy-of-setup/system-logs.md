# System Logs

Logs is a list of system activity. There are only three functions available on this page; “Clear”, “Refresh” and “Export All Data” buttons, all situated to the upper right of the screen. The Export All Data button appears as a black folder encircling a white X. The Date, Source and Type columns also have basic data manipulation toggles next to the column name. The Message column displays the type of error message.
